\section{Introduction}

This is a compiled set of notes to supplement University of Illinois at Chicago's MATH 585 course. The course is title \textit{Ordinary Differential Equations}, and focuses on quantitative, qualitative, and analytic aspects of ordinary differential equations in finite dimensions. The intent for these notes is to supplement students' studying, in both the writing and reading of this document, to prepare them for the UIC MSCS preliminary exam in differential equations. \\
\indent The course focused on 7 topics: Existence and Uniqueness of ODEs, linear systems, introduction to dynamical systems, planar systems, higher-dimensional dynamics, local behavior near fixed points, and periodic solutions of autonomous equations. Our goal is to cover at least these topics in a way complementary to the course. This is, at current, a living document and may contain extra material.
